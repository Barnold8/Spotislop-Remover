## Installation 

### Prerequisites

- Python
- Spotify account

### Making a venv

It is recommended to create a venv for this app such that you don't need to worry or care about versions of libraries already installed on your system and also to avoid installing packages system wide. If this doesn't matter to you, skip this step

To make a venv you simply need to be within the **\<src>** folder and run the command

```python -m venv .```

This will generate a new venv for your web app. From there you can access the scripts folder and run the corresponding activate file for your system. For more information see [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)
